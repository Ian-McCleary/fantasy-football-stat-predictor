# fantasyfootballstatpredictor

<p>This is a web scraping application built in python for a CSCI110 assignment in 2018. The application scrapes fantasy football player data and uses a linear regression algorithm to predict their points in the next game. The application's focus was on web scraping and GUI since humans do not perform in a linear fassion. Sadly, this web scraping app no longer works due to changes in website structure. </p>
